This plugin utilizes Google reCAPTCHA to help your blog stay clear of spams.
BWP reCAPTCHA supports no CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA, Contact Form 7 and Akismet.

== Description ==

In the 21th century, spamming could be one of the most annoying problems for a
website. Especially if you use some publishing platforms like WordPress, your
blog WILL be spammed and no default methods will save you from such nightmare.
This plugin utilizes the popular anti-spam library, Google reCAPTCHA, to help
your blog stay clear of spams.

The new no CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA, Contact Form 7 and Akismet are supported out of
the box.

== Changelog ==

= 2.0.3 (2016-01-13) =

-   **New Features**
    -   Allow adding custom CSS rules to control the look and feel of
        recaptcha instances. To enable this feature, navigate to *BWP
        reCAPT >> Theme Options*, choose to enable Custom CSS, and then
        customize the default CSS rules however you like.
-   **Enhancements**
    -   Allow setting a request method to work around the "invalid-json" error.
        With this change fsockopen is preferred to cURL, and will be the first
        to be used to communicate with reCAPTCHA's server.
-   **Other Changes**
    -   Marked as compatible with WordPress 4.4+.
    -   Update language template file and translation files. If you're a
        translator, please help translating this plugin (your name and website
        will be listed on this plugin's page!) For more info, see:
        <http://betterwp.net/wordpress-tips/create-pot-file-using-poedit/>
-   **Bugs fixed**
    -   Fix a bug that results in captcha not showing on certain login pages.
        Affected login pages include:
        -   Login page that uses secured HTTP (HTTPS)
        -   Login page of a child blog in a sub-directory multisite
            installation.

= 2.0.2 (2015-10-30) =

-   **New Features**
    -   Add an option to treat invalid captcha as spam or a validation error.
        For more info, see:
        <http://contactform7.com/spam-filtering-with-akismet/>.
        -   If you treat invalid captcha as validation error, it is now
            possible to customize the error message shown under the captcha
            as well.
        -   Previously, for the `recaptcha` shortcode tag to work you must add
            it to your form like this: `[recaptcha a-field-name]`. The field
            name is now optional, but is still needed if you want to show the
            error message.
-   **Other Changes**
    -   Update language template file. If you're a translator, please help
        translating this plugin! For more info, see:
        <http://betterwp.net/wordpress-tips/create-pot-file-using-poedit/>
    -   Display recaptcha error code when an unknown error occurs.
    -   Show the option to toggle recaptcha version in PHP 5.3.2+ only. This
        means in PHP < 5.3.2 there's no option to select recaptcha version,
        recaptcha version 1 will always be used. This should affect the theme
        options page as well.
    -   Add back support for PHP 5.2.
-   **Bugs fixed**
    -   Should always set a correct width for login/registration form so
        recaptcha fits well inside.
    -   Fix recaptcha v1's display in themes that define `table-layout: fixed`
    -   Auto-detect request method for recaptcha v2 to support server with
        `allow_url_fopen` disabled.

= 2.0.0 =

-   **New Features**
    -   Add support for reCAPTCHA version 2
    -   Add support for multiple reCAPTCHA instances per page (reCAPTCHA
        version 2 only)
    -   Add an HTTPS setting for reCAPTCHA version 1
-   **Enhancements**
    -   Add support for Contact Form version 4.x
    -   Add support for custom login/register paths
    -   Add reCAPTCHA before the submit field in comment form for WordPress 4.2
        or higher
    -   Use a lower priority when filter the `comment_form_defaults` filter
        hook so reCAPTCHA can still be added to themes that filter it as well
-   **Other Changes**
    -   Change minimum PHP version required to 5.3.2
    -   Show the captcha to all users (including admins) by default
    -   Contact Form 7:
        -   The shortcode `[bwp-recaptcha]` has been deprecated, use
            `[recaptcha recaptcha-xxx]` instead.
        -   `bwp-recaptcha` will continue to work for Contact Form 7 prior to
            version 4.1 (last supported is 4.0.3). `bwprecaptcha` and
            `bwp_recaptcha` will still work with version 4.1+, so you won't
            have to manually update any form if you're using them.
    -   Add a Croatian translation
    -   Layerthemes.com has become an official sponsor for BWP Plugins!
-   **Bugs fixed**
    -   Fix Akismet integration not working properly
    -   Don't output comment form related fields in other forms, which leads to
        extraneous markups in Contact Form 7 forms
    -   Create session only when needed and on demand
    -   Fix an issue where saving sub blog's API keys overwrites network's API
        keys in a multisite installation

        reCAPTCHA library is now autoloaded whenever needed (for reCAPTCHA
        version 1).
